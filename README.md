# haskellFold

Provide a better folding for haskell file. The folded lines are transformed
to display the type signature (if any) of the function, providing a great
overview of your file content.

You can get a shorter version of the foldtext (only the first relevant line)
by setting `g:haskellFold_ShortText = 1`

# Installation

Drop the file in ~/.vim/plugin or ~/vimfiles/plugin folder, or if you
use pathogen into the ~/.vim/bundle/vim-haskellFold or
~/vimfiles/bundle/vim-haskellFold
